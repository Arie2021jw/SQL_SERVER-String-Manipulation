This repository contains multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to manipulate strings.

List of examples:
1) Sorting a column having strings having only letters
2) Sorting a column having mixed Alphanumeric values
3) Parsing through a string while changing the parameters of Function SUBSTRING
4) Parsing through a string to retrieve each character on a different row
5) Create delimited lists by commas from table rows
6) Convert delimited lists by commas into lists to use on IN clause
7) Alphabetize the individual characters within a string
